    \section{Introduction}</p>
<p>
    This is a specification of a simple scheduler and assembler. The
    system contains a set of registers and a block of memory. Processes
    can be created, with each containing a sequence on instructions that
    are executed on the system. The instruction format is a simplified
    format of the Intel x86 architecture. Processes are scheduled based on
    the credit system that is found in the Linux 2.0 kernel.</p>
<p>
    \section{Stack}</p>
<p>
    This specification was written as a test spec for the CZT project. As
    a result, there are parts that may appear to be specified in a strange
    way - this is to test out the tools on a large set of Z.</p>
<p>
    A generic stack.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    \ZDeclSummary</p>
<p>
    Ok, lets see the value of \thecntZunboxed!</p>
<p>
    \section{Definitions}</p>
<p>
    Firstly, we define some basic types and functions that are used
    throughout the specification.</p>
<p>
    $singleton$ is the set of all sets whose size is less than or equal to~$1$.
    This is included only to have a generic axiom definition.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    The basic type of this system is a word, which specifically, is an
    unsigned octet. An unsigned word is used so references to memory etc a
    1-relative.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    Then, we define the size of the memory block, and give it a value for
    animation purposes.</p>
<div class="z-axiom">
</div>
<p>
    A $LABEL$ is used to label instructions for $jump$ instructions etc,
    although 'jump' hasn't been specified yet.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    Now we define the different instructions, as well as their operands. A
    $CONSTANT$ is used both as a constant value, as well as a memory
    reference for load and store instructions.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    An instruction is specified as a instruction name, a sequence of
    operands, and optionally, a label.</p>
<p>
    \ZDeclSummary</p>
<p>
    \section{System}</p>
<p>
    The system consists of a set of registers, and a block of
    memory. There is also a buffer for displaying output.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    Initially, all registers and memory hold the minimum $WORD$ value. The
    output buffer is empty.</p>
<p>
    The system can have arithmetic and memory instructions.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    A print instruction prints the value of a register.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    $val$ maps constants to their value, and $dereference$ dereferences
    the value of a register, transitively if required.</p>
<div class="z-axiom">
</div>
<p>
    The specification of the arithmetic instructions.</p>
<p>
    The {\tt load} operation loads a constant from memory. The second
    parameter is an index to the memory location from which the constant
    is loaded.</p>
<p>
    {\tt loadConst} loads a constant into a register. The second parameter
    the constant to be loaded.</p>
<p>
    Store the value of a register in memory.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    The specification of the stack instructions on the system.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    This executes an instruction on the on the system. $inst?$ is the
    instruction to execute, and $base?$ is the base memory value of the
    executing process. If the instruction is a {\tt load} or {\tt store}
    instruction, the memory reference must offset using the base value.</p>
<p>
    \ZDeclSummary</p>
<p>
    \section{Scheduler}</p>
<p>
    This part of the specification is the scheduler.</p>
<p>
    Here, we declare the set of process IDs, the priority values, and the
    default number of credits a process receives when it is created.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    The possible status that a process can hold.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    A process consists of a process ID, a status, a number of credits, and
    a priority. Each process has a sequence of instructions to be executed
    on the assembler, with a pointer to the current instruction. The
    memory that a process can occupy is between a base and limit
    value. Instructions must only access memory with a value less than the
    limit, but they know nothing about the base value - this is added onto
    the memory index provided by the instruction when an instruction is
    executed. Each procss also contains a stack and values for all
    registers, which are used to store values when the process is
    suspended.</p>
<p>
    The $sort$ function takes the credits and priorities of all processes,
    and returns a sequence of process IDS sorted firstly by their credits
    (the more credits a process has, the higher preference they get), and
    if the credits are equal, then their priority. If the priority is
    equal, then the order is non-deterministic.</p>
<div class="z-axiom">
</div>
<p>
    To interrupt a process during execution, the kernel must be in $kernel$ mode.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    For the scheduler, we track which mode the operating system is in, as
    well as declaring three ``secondary'' variables, $waiting$, $running$,
    and $ready$, to keep the sets of waiting running, and ready variables
    respecitvely. In fact, $ready$ is a sequence, and is ordered based on
    the credits that each process has. A process with more credits will
    have a higher priority. This is fair scheduling, because at each timer
    interrupt (the $tick$ operation specified below), the current process
    losses one credit, therefore, process spending a lot of time executing
    will eventually have a low priority.</p>
<p>
    This uses semicolons as conjunctions for predicates, which conforms to
    the grammar in the ISO standard, but according to the list of
    differences between ZRM and ISO Z on Ian Toyn's website, semicolons
    can no longer be used to conjoin predicates.</p>
<p>
    $newProcess$ creates a new process with a unique process ID and a
    specified priority, and places this new process on the ready queue.</p>
<p>
    We define a schema that contains only the variables that do not change
    when a reschedule occurs.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    A reschedule occurs when all ready processes have no credits. Every
    process, not just the ready processes, have their credits
    re-calculated using the formula $credits = credits/2 + priority$. This
    implies that the ready process with the highest priority will be the
    next process executed.</p>
<p>
    We declare a new schema that contains only the state variables that do
    not change when a status change occurs.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    Interrupts the currently executing process if the new process is of a
    higher priority then the current process and the kernel is in $kernel$
    mode.</p>
<p>
    Remove the currently running process and put it back in the ready queue.</p>
<p>
    A process becomes blocked if it is waiting on a resource such a an IO
    device, or waiting on another process</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    We declare a schema containing only the variables that change for an
    unblock.</p>
<div class="z-zed">
</div>
<p>
    Unblocks a process that is blocked by another process.</p>
<p>
    Remove a process from the system</p>
<p>
    Update the details in the process table when each instruction is
    executed, as well as communicate the current instruction and the base
    value for the current process.</p>
